    phishing: {
      title: 'Phishing Guide',
      intro: `
        <p>Phishing is a common method in which an attacker tries to cheat on sensitive information such as passwords or bank / card information via email, text message, or other channels.</p>
        <p>Sometimes there are also links that take the user to a page that looks genuine (such as a copy of a bank's login page) where the attacker tries to trick the user into entering their information or downloading malicious code.</p>
      `,
      read: `
        <h2>Read the text carefully!</h2>
        <p>Phishing emails are often machine translated with both misspellings and strange wording.</p>
        <p>Official emails almost always contain a signature with contact information at the bottom, but are often missing in phishing emails.</p>
      `,
      links: `
        <h2>Check sender address and links</h2>
        <p>Remember to be careful about clicking on links, attachments or downloading programs that come via email, text messages or various web pages.</p>
        <p>Hold the mouse pointer over both the sender address and links so you can see where they point in plain text, usually in the lower left corner of the browser.</p>
        <p>In the picture below you can see a link that seems to go to <i>www.swedbank.se</i>. Can you find the error?</p>
      `,
      links2: `
        <h2>Check sender address and links</h2>
        <p>Pay attention to the addresses! Similar domains are often used to try to deceive the user, for example nordea@gmail.com instead of noreply@nordea.se.</p>
      `,
      suspicion: `
        <p>In case of suspicion of phishing, but where you are still unsure, it is best to contact the alleged sender via other channels, e.g. phone. Then you can verify if the email is genuine.</p>
      `,
      summary: `
        <h2>In summary:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Always read the mail carefully before opening any files or links</li>
          <li>Never share your card / account number or password</li>
          <li>If phishing is suspected, you should verify the sender through other channels</li>

      `,
      page1: `
        <p>Some people who write news or spread information internally have a hidden agenda. They may try to mislead, influence or skew information to suit their purpose. This is called fake news.</p>
      `,
      page2: `
        <p>Fake news is often emotionally written, forced and can be perceived as strange. Do not believe everything you read without double-checking other sources. It can be difficult to know which pages to trust so double checking is always good.</p>
      `,
      page3: `
        <p>Serious news sites always have a person who is the responsible publisher and describes their political positions. Look for the headline "about us" or similar, where it usually says so. If you want to be sure that information is correct, they are good to read official government information.</p>

        <p>Fraudsters try to deceive by creating fake ads on the block, for example, and trading. A common way is for them to ask for a down payment for an item that is not then delivered.</p>
        <p>Protect yourself by settling the deal physically or with a secure payment service where both buyers and sellers need to identify themselves before payment.</p>
      `,
      page2: `
        <p>There are also scammers and criminals who create websites where they commit fraud by selling products that are then never delivered.</p>
        <p>Even when trading via websites run by companies, it is a good idea to check that the site's owner is serious and to use a secure payment service that enables payment in arrears via invoice.</p>
      `,
      page3: `
        <p>A common way to cheat on social media is to create accounts in fake names and then contact users and ask for money in various ways. Sometimes someone can pretend to be a friend in need.</p>
        <p>Always be suspicious when asking for money on the internet. If someone you know asks for help with money, you should always call the person and confirm that it really is the person you are talking to.</p>
